# Quick Fix for Missing Images

## The Issue
External images from Unsplash may not load due to:
- Internet connection issues
- Browser security settings
- CORS policies
- Ad blockers

## The Solution
I've added fallback desert-colored gradients that will display even if external images fail to load.

## What You'll See Now
- **If images load:** Beautiful desert photos
- **If images don't load:** Animated desert-colored gradients (tan, gold, cream colors)

## Both Look Professional!
The gradients are designed to match the desert theme with warm, sandy colors that animate smoothly.

## For DevOps
When implementing, you can replace these with:
1. Locally hosted images (faster, more reliable)
2. Your own CDN
3. The actual video from the live website
